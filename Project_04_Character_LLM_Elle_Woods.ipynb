Instead, it builds on the existing capabilities of a large, instruction-tuned base model and applies **LoRA-based fine-tuning** to encode a *specific character personality* (Elle Woods) into the model’s behavior. By using LoRA, only a small fraction of parameters are updated, allowing the model to retain its general reasoning and language abilities while learning **how to respond**, rather than **what to know**. The focus of training is therefore on **voice, tone, emotional structure, and consistency**, not on acquiring new factual knowledge.\n",
